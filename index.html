Most engineering institutions have sadly turned into schools to produce degree bearers. However, CET gave you freedom and room to experiment, make your own mistakes and still have fun. I attribute that to the reason why CET, on top of producing top notch engineers and technologists, also have a long list of film-makers, politicians, technocrats and writers as their alumni.

It’s choices like this that are most challenging to me - whatever be the decision to take. That associated opportunity cost : What do you lose when you pick something over the other? I usually deal with this by dissecting things in detail -- it’s time consuming, but then again, it’s part of my habit.

We have a large resource pool of senior alumni who we can tap for their networks, guidance and opportunities for our students. I know some positive changes have taken place in recent years. I hope that continues. I hope to see more of our older alumni getting involved and returning to college to share their stories and experiences.

								<h4>New Microsoft patent may turn your smartphone into a handheld Xbox
								</h4>
								<p>In an apparent bid to take on the popular Nintendo gaming Switch, a new Microsoft patent has revealed plans for controllers that would turn your smartphone into hand-held Xbox.
								According to a report in Digital Trends late Sunday, the patent shows "a charging device for removable input modules. While there is no specific mention of the Xbox in the application, a couple of the drawings feature all-too-familiar buttons and symbols".
								Possible features for the controllers include built-in speakers, a headphone jack, and wireless headphones support.
								The detachable controllers in the patent looks similar to the Nintendo Switch but a key difference with Nintendo's hybrid console is that Microsoft controllers would "focus on enabling the Project xCloud video game streaming service on mobile phones".
								According to Microsoft, Project xCloud's state-of-the-art global game-streaming technology will offer you the freedom to play on the device you want without being locked to a particular device.

								<h4>Microsoft's Digital Crime Unit busy catching cyber thugs in India</h4>
								<p>In a significant operation earlier this month, the cyber cell of Delhi Police arrested 24 people who posed as Microsoft tech support staff and duped several US citizens.
									This could not have been possible without the the real-time monitoring of cyber crimes by Microsoft's Digital Crime Unit (DCU) in Redmond that is using Cloud, Big Data, Machine Learning (ML) and Business Intelligence (BI) to improve the security of its products and services, protect vulnerable populations, fight malware, and reduce digital risks.
									The real-time data analytics and sharing of key inputs with relevant law enforcement agencies helped bust 10 companies that were illegally running call centres at various places in Delhi that targeted Microsoft Windows users.
									"It was real-time monitoring that helped us crack the Delhi gang behind the large-scale tech support fraud. The whole operation has been encouraging in our fight against cyber crimes," Shilpa Bratt, Director (Shared Services) of Digital Crimes Unit, told IANS.

								<h4>LG dual screen phone teased, will be launched at IFA 2019
								</h4>
								<p>LG dual screen phone is slated to be launched at the upcoming IFA 2019 in Berlin. The dual screen phone is expected to be the V60 ThinQ.
									LG Electronics on Monday unveiled a teaser video of the second 5G phone with a detachable dual screen, which is set to make its global debut next month.LG plans to launch the new smartphone on September 6 on the eve of the Internationale Funkausstellung (IFA) in Berlin, Europe’s largest tech show, four months after releasing the V50 ThinQ.
									The 15-second video titled “Dual, the Better” shows an hour hand move from 6 o’ clock to 12 o’ clock in a half-face watch screen, indicating an upgraded movement of the second screen of V50, which can be positioned at either 104 degree or 180 degree, Yonhap news agency has reported.
									The new 5G phone, tentatively named V60, is expected to face stiff competition from Samsung’s Galaxy Note 10, set for late August, and Galaxy Fold, late September launch.

								<h4>The Contemporary Acopalypse </h4>
								</h4>	<h5 style="text-align: right">by Arun Jose <br> S2</h5><br>
								<p>The power of hindsight as a source of insight is often understated. Looking back into history, one could identify the German condition after World War 1 as the perfect breeding ground for unbridled powerlust. We look at the Dark Ages, and deem fit to call it so, because it seems obvious to us that the spread of scientific pursuit is what propels
									 us forward. This begs the question, then: what would the future see our time as? 

										World War 2 saw underground shelters to counter air raids, the Cold War saw nuclear bunkers to survive a fallout, and today, the tradition lives on, with billionaires throwing their monies at comfortable impenetrable bunkers. But this is no longer the age of nuclear holocaust. It is not quite that a bunker won't protect you, it's that a 
										sufficiently advanced AI wouldn't let you get to the bunker at all. If we told a superintelligence to just cure cancer, without aligning it more on actual end goals, it might look upon humanity, and decide that enslaving and experimenting on them would be the swiftest way to achieve its goals. This is the age of insufficient AI alignment theory.

								<h4>Neural Networks</h4>
								<h5 style="text-align: right">by Blesson John Abraham<br>M1</h5><br>
								<p>Neural networks are multi-layer networks of neurons where each nodes in every layer is interconnected with all the nodes on next layer (to previous layer also in case of feedback networks ) that we use to classify things, make predictions, etc 
										.<br> 1. The input layer of our model in orange.<br> 
										2. Our first hidden layer of neurons in blue. <br>
										3. Our second hidden layer of neurons in magenta. <br>
										4. The output layer (a.k.a. the prediction) of our model in green <br>
										<b>Artificial neural network</b> 
										A neural network contains layers of interconnected nodes. Each node is a perceptron and is similar to a multiple linear regression. The perceptron feeds the signal produced by a multiple linear regression into an activation function that may be nonlinear. 
										In a multi-layered perceptron (MLP), perceptrons are arranged in interconnected layers. The input layer collects input patterns. The output layer has classifications or output signals to which input patterns may map. 
										Hidden layers adjusts the input weightings until the neural network’s margin of error is minimal. Each input is a weighted input , the perceptron fires only if the sum of the weighted inputs exceeds a threshold value . 
										<br><b>Advantages</b><br>

										ANNs have some key advantages that make them most suitable for certain problems and situations: 
										<br>1. ANNs have the ability to learn and model non-linear and complex relationships, which is really important because in real-life, many of the relationships between inputs and outputs are non-linear as well as complex. 
										<br>2. ANNs can generalize — After learning from the initial inputs and their relationships, it can infer unseen relationships on unseen data as well, thus making the model generalize and predict on unseen data. 
										<br>3. Unlike many other prediction techniques, ANN does not impose any restrictions on the input variables (like how they should be distributed). Additionally, many studies have shown that ANNs can better model heteroskedasticity i.e. data with high volatility and non-constant variance, given its ability to learn hidden relationships in the data without imposing any fixed relationships in the data. This is something very useful in financial time series forecasting (e.g. stock prices) where data volatility is very high. 
										<br><b>Conclusion</b><br> 
										Neural networks are one of the most beautiful programming paradigms ever invented. In the conventional approach to programming, we tell the computer what to do and break big problems up into many small, precisely defined tasks that the computer can easily perform. In contrast, we don’t tell the computer how to solve our problems for a neural network. Instead, it learns from observational data and figures out its own solution to the problem
